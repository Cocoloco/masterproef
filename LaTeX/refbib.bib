  abstract = {With the proliferation of internet-based social networks into our lives, new mechanisms to control the release and use of personal data are required. As a step toward this goal, we develop a recommendation system which protects the privacy of user answers while allowing them to learn an aggregate weighted average of ratings. Due to the use of social network connections, the querier obtains a more relevant and trustworthy result than what generic anonymous recommendation systems can provide, while at the same time preserving user privacy. We also give experimental performance results for our solution and several recently developed secure computation techniques, which is of independent interest.},

@InProceedings{LCA-CONF-2009-014,
   abstract    = {In recommender systems, usually, a central server needs
                 to have access to users' profiles in order to generate
                 useful recommendations. Having this access, however,
                 undermines the users' privacy. The more information is
                 revealed to the server on the user-item relations, the
                 lower the users' privacy is. Yet, hiding part of the
                 profiles to increase the privacy comes at the cost of
                 recommendation accuracy or difficulty of implementing the
                 method. In this paper, we propose a distributed mechanism
                 for users to augment their profiles in a way that
                 obfuscates the user-item connection to an untrusted
                 server, with minimum loss on the accuracy of the
                 recommender system. We rely on the central server to
                 generate the recommendations. However, each user stores
                 his profile offline, modifies it by partly merging it
                 with the profile of similar users through direct contact
                 with them, and only then periodically uploads his profile
                 to the server. We propose a metric to measure privacy at
                 the system level, using graph matching concepts. Applying
                 our method to the Netflix prize dataset, we show the
                 effectiveness of the algorithm in solving the tradeoff
                 between privacy and accuracy in recommender systems in an
                 applicable way.},
